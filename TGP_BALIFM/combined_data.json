        "text_content": "Bali is booming with development projects, from new hotels to new apartment complexes and beyond. Around every corner and in every resort town new properties are being built.  One apartment complex in particular is set to boast the world’s longest rooftop pool. Magnum Estate is the property development company behind the Magum Residence Berawa. The project, which is already underway, will feature luxury apartments and five-star service.  Overlooking Canggu’s most iconic beach, the Magnum Residence Berawa is touted to feature a “rooftop that has no equals in the world.”  A post shared by Magnum Estate – Real Estate Developer in Bali (@magnum.estate) Mock-ups of what the site will look like at completion show a modern, angular building, with a luxuriously furnished rooftop and a long infinity pool that runs the full length of the apartment building; a whopping 190m.  The site sits just 500m from Berawa Beach and is within a short drive of all of Canggu’s world-famous beach clubs, emerging fine dining scene, and independent boutiques.  The Magnum Residence Berawa is set for completion in the last quarter of 2025, so tourists and expats have some time to wait before they can jump into the world’s longest rooftop pool.  The apartment complex will feature one-bedroom apartments, starting at USD 350,000, and two-bedroom apartments, for USD 590,000; all of which overlook the ocean. A post shared by Magnum Estate – Real Estate Developer in Bali (@magnum.estate) The property is appealing to property investors and those looking to establish a second home in Bali since Magnum Residence Berawa has said that apartment owners can rent out their property, reside in it themselves, or use it as a vacation home that’s available at any time.  Canggu is easily the most busy tourist resort in Bali right now. The iconic surf destination is bustling with tourists from all over the world.  The evolution of Canggu as a destination has happened at lightning speed, even in light of the pandemic. Less than ten years ago Canggu was a quiet Balinese village, home to a few expats, and frequented by surfers.  Then came the more adventurous backpackers and digital nomads, followed by the holidaymakers seeking something a little off the beaten track. For many, Canggu has become the party capital of South East Asia.  A post shared by Vilas Boas Invest (@vilasboasinvest) The Magnum Residence Berawa is just one of hundreds of major building projects underway in Bali right now. Magnum Estate as a company is also developing huge complexes in Sanur, Seminyak, Umalas, and the Bukit Peninsula.  Such huge amounts of investment into tourism accommodation and investment properties have been celebrated by some as a sign of positive economic development in Bali.  But just as many Bali lovers have been vocal in their concerns that the level of development is unsustainable.  Earlier this year the community in Seseh successfully petitioned against the construction of a massive apartment and holiday villa complex.  The community, of local residents, ex-pats, and regular visitors to the surf village, all came together to call out the potentially destructive nature of the project.  The development company has said they’re going back to the drawing board to ensure that projects take on board the opinions and advice of the local authorities and the local community.  Down in Uluwatu, the community is also banding together to call out the rapid development of apartment complexes that they feel are spoiling the natural charm of the coastal retreat.  The group Stop Uluwatu Destruction has been working to establish awareness to help “stop the Cangguization and destruction of Uluwatu.” All this development does mean that Bali is becoming a tourist destination that can boast the world’s first and only in many categories.  The island is also home to the world’s biggest beach club, which itself is home to the world’s longest poolside bar.  Atlas Beach Club, also in Canggu, is one of the most popular beach club venues in Bali. The complex only opened its doors in 2022 but has quickly become the go-to party destination in the area.  "

        "text_content": "Tourists traveling to Bali in the coming weeks are being urged to be vigilant about the risk of rabies.  This news comes after two more residents were bitten by a dog that has gone on to test positive for rabies. Humans can contract rabies by being bitten by animals that carry the virus, such as dogs and monkeys.  There are tens of thousands of dogs in Bali. Many are pet or community-owned dogs, and some are strays.  The provincial and regency governments have solid programs in place to help prevent the spread of rabies.  Free mass vaccination clinics for dogs are held on a regular basis throughout the island, and at the busiest monkey temples, the wild troops of monkeys are also regularly vaccinated against rabies.  However, there has been an increasing number of reports of both residents and tourists getting bitten by dogs and monkeys.  It has been made public that two residents who live near Keramas Beach were bitten by the same rabies-positive dog on the same day.  The pair are receiving anti-rabies vaccination treatment. With this in mind, tourists heading to Bali are reminded to check their rabies vaccination status and take suitable precautions to mitigate the risk of a bite.  From the Bali side, a Rabies Alert Team will be deployed across the capital to help suppress transmission. The Head of the Denpasar City Agriculture Service, AA Bayu Brahmasta, has called for all stakeholders to take an even more proactive approach to tackling rabies in Bali.  He told reporters “The Rabies Alert Team will be tasked with providing education and outreach to the community.”  A post shared by Bali Animal Welfare Assoc. (@bawabali_official) The Rabies Alert Team will operate primarily in Denpasar though localised rabies response teams are in operation throughout the regencies, as well as animal welfare organisations like BAWA who also do work to vaccinate animals and educate communities.  Brahmasta added “The Denpasar City Agriculture Service is maximizing [the work of] the Rabies Alert Team. This team is tasked with providing education to the public to minimize the spread of rabies and minimize the incident of bite victims.” According to Brahmasta, there are 82,195 known rabies-transmitting animals in Denpasar City alone, with vaccination coverage of over 70%.  However, an islandwide rabies vaccination shortage is proving a concern for both humans and animals.  On Monday 20th November the Head of Disease Prevention and Control for Denpasar City, Dr. Anak Agung Ngurah Gede Dharmayuda, called on the public not to panic amid the anti-rabies vaccination shortage.  It is not only in Denpasar City where there is a storage of anti-rabies vaccines. In Buleleng Regency, this week’s stock sits at just 300 doses.  The Head of the Buleleng District Health Service, Dr. Sucipto, said that he and his teams are prioritizing high-risk bite cases given the shortage.  Dr Sucipto told reporters “Previously there was some leeway in the policy of giving anti-rabies vaccine, but after the availability became minimal, we made a more selective process of vaccines and gave them to high-risk bite cases.” On average, Buleleng Regency alone sees four bite cases every day.  The shortage of anti-rabies vaccine in Bali is being felt by tourists. Last week an Australian mother on vacation told reporters of their ordeal after her 10-year-old daughter was bitten by a monkey at the Ubud Sacred Monkey Forest.  Amanda Tabone told reporters that she was turned away from one hospital that told her they had no anti-rabies vaccination in stock.  Tabone had to contact her insurance providers in Australia in order to track down a hospital with vaccine supplies.  Her caught did receive a course of anti-rabies vaccinations, immunoglobin treatment, and herpes medication as a precaution following the bite.  "

There is also an island-wide initiative to integrate traditional medicine and healing with modern scientific medicine practices. It is all part of a bigger move to promote cultural, sustainable tourism to international visitors by way of encouraging them to stay longer and spend more on vacation. "

        "text_content": "Travelers planning to spend Christmas and New Year in Bali may be in for a shock if they look at ticket prices this week.  As the Indonesian Central Statistics Agency and Ministry for Transport reveal new travel figures ahead of the Christmas holidays, airlines appear to be hiking their prices.  Just last week the Indonesian Minster for Tourism and Creative Economies, Sanidaga Uno, confirmed to reporters that airports and airlines across the country will be putting on more flights to meet increased demand for travel this festive season. Speaking to reporters during a visit to Yogyakarta, Minister Uno shared “With the increase in the number of flights and the availability of seats, the supply will increase, and at Christmas and New Year we hope that airline ticket prices will be stable and affordable.” This was a hope echoed by many tourists, domestic and international. However, this week some Bali flights have soared in price, while others have been heavily discounted. It’s time to get scouring the flight search engines!  With Black Friday deals already live for some airlines, travelers are already searching for deals.  A post shared by Imigrasi Ngurah Rai (@imngurahrai) The Ministry of Transportation and the Transportation Policy Agency has published the results of a nationwide survey of domestic travelers and their travel plans for the Christmas and New Year holidays this year.  I Gusti Ngurah Rai International Airport will be the busiest airport in the country, alongside Soekarno Hatta Airport in Jakarta.  Latest travel deals show that the cheapest one-way direct flight tickets between the capital Jakarta and Bali cost between IDR 985,000 and IDR 1 million for economy class sets with Air Asia, Super Air Jet, and Pelita Air, starting from 19th December.  Throughout the rest of the year, flights between the two cities are considerably lower, especially when booked in advance.  A post shared by Fly AirAsia (@flyairasia) In terms of international flights, the fluctuations in ticket prices have not yet been too significant. In fact, for tourists planning long-haul journeys to Bali, Garuda Indonesia may just be worth checking out.  The country’s national carrier is hosting the Garuda Indonesia International Travel Fair (GATF) event online and in partnership with travel agents.  Discounts of up to 80% are featured in the travel deals to leading destinations in Indonesia from Hong Kong, Singapore, and Seoul. For tens of thousands of long-haul travelers to Bali, a layover in Hong Kong, Singapore, Bangkok or Kuala Lumpur is necessary.  For those traveling between now and November 25th, 2024, it might be worth spending some time scrolling for deals.  It may be possible to snap up a round-trip flight from Bali to Singapore, Hong Kong, or Seoul and then book the first/last leg of the long-haul trip on a separate booking.  A post shared by Garuda Indonesia | The Airline of Indonesia (@garuda.indonesia) Speaking to reporters Garuda Indonesia President Director Irfaniaputra said “Optimizing various peak season periods at the end of the year and in 2024, it is hoped that this GATF International event can optimize the level of foreign tourist visits to Indonesia through the availability of attractive offers to enjoy the end of year holidays in various destinations in Indonesia via direct flights from Hong Kong, Singapore and Seoul.” Infraniaputra concluded In addition to accommodating the increasingly competitive accessibility of flight services for international passengers, we hope that holding the 2023 International GATF can be momentum in itself in encouraging the growth of international tourist movements towards Indonesia.” What is clear is that Bali will be busy this Christmas and New Year holiday. Last year, over one million tourists arrived on the island for the holidays.  The Indonesian Minister of Transportation Budi Karya Sumadi, has confirmed that over 107 million Indonesian tourists will be traveling domestically this festive season.  A survey has shown that 45% of domestic travelers are planning to visit major tourist destinations in Indonesia, such as Bali. The atmosphere in Bali over the Christmas and New Year period is always buzzing and celebratory. Although Bali is a majority Balinese Hindu province, within the majority Muslim nation of Indonesia, Christmas is widely celebrated. "

        "text_content": "Indonesia is the largest majority Muslim nation in the world, but that doesn’t mean that Christmas is just another day of the week.  Nationwide there are over 29 million Christians who celebrate the festive season, and although Bali is a majority Balinese Hindu province, Christmas is a big deal on the Island of the Gods.  Data revealed this week by the Ministry of Transportation through the Transportation Policy Agency gives a solid indication of how many people in Indonesia are planning to travel over the Christmas and New Year period.  While it may come as no surprise that I Gusti Ngurah Rai International Airport will be one of the best transportation hubs over the two-week period, the sheer number of people on the move is a lot to wrap your head around.  Survey results reveal that it is anticipated that the potential for community and domestic tourist movement will reach 107.63 million people or 39.83% of the total national population this Christmas holiday.  In a written statement the Indonesian Minister of Transportation Budi Karya Sumadi revealed, “In last year’s Christmas holiday it was predicted that 44.17 million people would move, while this year it is predicted that it will be 107.63 million people. So the increase is very significant above 100% (143.65%).” The survey results suggest that 45% of domestic travelers will be heading to tourist destinations such as Bali, while 30% will be traveling to their homes outside of major cities, and 18% will be traveling to their families in their hometowns. Most domestic tourists will be traveling by road in private vehicles across the country. However, the survey shows that an increased amount of travelers will be using public transport where available. Domestic travelers set to travel by train is predicted to be 13.16%, 14.79 million people, and travelers by planes will reach 11.91% which is around 13.38 million people. The busiest airports will be I Gusti Ngurah Rai International in Bali and Soekarno Hatta Airport in Jakarta. These figures are only an indication of the number of domestic tourists on the move during the end of December.  In 2022, Bali welcomed over one million tourists, international and domestic combined between Christmas Eve and New Year.  Minister Sumadi concluded, “We will coordinate intensively with regional governments, the police, toll road managers, BMKG, the National SAR Agency, and other related elements.” The survey shows that the peak flow of outbound travel is set to take place on, Friday 22nd and Saturday 23rd December 2023, and 30th December.  The inbound peak travel dates are predicted to fall on Monday 1st and Tuesday 2nd January 2024.  For international travelers planning their Christmas and New Year vacations in Bali, what does this mean? I Gusti Ngurah Rai International Airport and partner airlines have already confirmed that more flights will be scheduled throughout December to help keep up with the huge spike in travel demand. Officials have said that this increased flight availability will also help stabilize prices, preventing tickets from skyrocketing, especially at the last minute.  Popular airlines like Air Asia, Batik Air, Indonesia’s Garuda, Citilink, Lion Air, and Super Air Jet have all laid on increased international and domestic flights in preparation for next month. Tourists planning to travel by driving around the island over the Christmas and New Year holidays should brace for traffic, especially traveling to and from the airport and heading to the island’s biggest attractions.  It is very popular for tourists on vacation in Bali to spend a few nights in one resort, and a few nights in another area of the island. It is highly advisable to travel as early in the morning as possible between resorts in order to reduce the risk of being caught in traffic during the holidays. "

        "text_content": "As a travel destination, Bali has a lot to offer nature lovers and wildlife enthusiasts. For decades, swimming with turtles has been a bucket-list adventure that Bali has been all too ready to offer tourists.  But as tourism on the island continues to boom, conservationists are concerned about the influence development has on turtle habitats.  The Founder of the Kuta Beach Sea Turtle Conservation Center (KBSTCC) I Gusti Ngurah Tresna, also known affectionately as Mr Turtle, has been an advocate for the wellbeing of wild turtles in Kuta Beach and the surrounding areas for decades.  Tresna has recently reached out to reporters to share his observations about how tourism is changing turtle nestling habits in the island’s busiest beaches.  For centuries, turtles have been laying their eggs on Kuta Beach. But as beach use changes the environment, Tresna is noticing that turtles are moving to different locations to nest.  He and his teams have seen that German Beach and Sekeh Beach, and to the north, Legian Beach and Seminyak Beach are also seeing increasing turtle nesting sites; but that overall, the number of nests is decreasing. A post shared by Bali Sea Turtle Society (BSTS) (@baliseaturtlesociety) Tresna told reporters “Indeed, currently the tendency for turtles to lay their eggs has shifted slightly to the south and north of Kuta Beach. Turtles look for places that are dark and not too busy.”  However, turtles nesting on Kuta Beach, German Beach, Sekeh Beach, Legian Beach, and Seminyak Beach are hardly welcomed by undisturbed peace.  All of these beaches have buildings either on the beach, or directly opposite the sand. Bright lights in the Kuta, Legian, and Seminyak area can be seen from as far along the Canggu, and even over the ocean along the Bukit Peninsula.  A post shared by Bali Sea Turtle Society (BSTS) (@baliseaturtlesociety) Tresna added “This does not mean that there are absolutely no turtles laying eggs along Kuta Beach. There are still turtles laying eggs in the Kuta Beach area, especially those without abrasion barriers, namely in front of the Kuta Beach Task Force office to the south.” He noted that coastal erosion also has a part to play in the changing nesting habits of turtles and that he and his teams support the work of Badung Regency to mitigate coastal erosion on Kuta Beach.  A post shared by Bali Sea Turtle Society (BSTS) (@baliseaturtlesociety) This week the Badung Regency Public Works and Spatial Planning (PUPR) Department is getting started on a new project to construct coastal revetments on a number of popular tourist beaches in an effort to protect the coast from abrasion.  Revetments will be built on Kuta Beach, and also at Pandawa Beach, Cemagi Beach, and Pererenan Beach. Speaking on behalf of the PUPR Badung Office, AA Rama Putra, told reporters “The work area is from the front of Bentar Utama Temple to the north.” “We hope that with this step we can maintain the sustainability of the environment around Kuta Beach and provide better protection for the affected infrastructure.”  Tourists will notice more building activity on Kuta Beach for the next 2-3 weeks. The work should be completed in time for the Christmas and New Year holidays.  Tresna told reporters, “We have been carrying out conservation efforts for 23 years. So when people find out that a turtle is laying eggs, they already know what to do. So they have covered it first and then informed us. Sometimes tourists also inform us.”  It is imperative that if tourists come across a turtle nest, especially if hatchings are being born, to not interfere with the process at all.  While many tourists worry that the turtles do not have the strength to hatch through the sand, intervening with the process poses a huge threat to their survival.  The nest should be left alone, cordoned off if possible and the teams at Kuta Beach Sea Turtle Conservation Center or the BKSDA informed.  Tresna revealed that so far this year at least 275 Olive Ridley turtle nests have been found in the Kuta Beach area, with a total of around 50-60 thousand eggs. However, this number is relatively low compared to the previous year.  He concluded “The turtle nesting season is usually March to October, then stops when the rainy season arrives. Now it’s a bit late, but this month alone we still found one nest appearing.” "

        "text_content": "In November alone three tourists in Bali have been reported to have died in traffic collisions on the island’s roads.  Tragically, around this time last year Bali also saw a sharp rise in the number of fatalities on the roads. With this in mind, authorities in Buleleng Regency are working to change the way tourists hire vehicles in hopes the same approach may be adopted island-wide.  In November three foreign nationals were killed on Buleleng Regency’s roads in separate incidents. On 3rd November a 24-year-old British tourist died in a hit-and-run in Tajun Village in broad daylight.  On 11th November a Czech tourist was killed in a collision with a truck in Pemuteran Village. On 14th November a 24-year-old Czech citizen was killed in a collision with a pickup truck in Pejarakan Village.  Concerned by the rising number of tourist collisions on Bali’s roads the Head of Traffic Unit for Buleleng Police, AKP Bachtiar Arifin, has spoken to reporters about how and where changes must be made.  AKP Arifin told reporters “What is clear is that we will carry out outreach to rental services and hotels, including limiting and selectively using motorbikes, especially foreign nationals.” He continued to explain that hotel owners who provide motorbike rental services will be asked to take preventative steps by accompanying foreign guests themselves if they want to travel by motorbike.  He said, “This is part of an effort to maintain the safety of foreigners staying at the hotels they accompany.”  AKP Arifin reminded tourists and motorcycle rental providers that the requirement for foreigners to ride motorbikes on the streets of Indonesia is to at least have an international driver’s license and to obey the laws of the road such as wearing a helmet.  He added “Apart from that, we will increase patrols in places where there are many foreigners. We will even carry out law enforcement if foreigners are found to be violating this.” Earlier this year, before his term as Bali governor came to a close, Wayan Koster formally banned tourists from hiring mopeds directly from local people.  Ex-Governor Koster doubled down on laws that state that foreigners may only rent vehicles from authorized providers. Koster made it clear that tourists can only hire a motorcycle from a business that is fully registered with the relevant provincial and national trade agencies or the transportation rental association in Bali. This reinforcement of the law means that tourists cannot rent a motorcycle from an accommodation provider owner, local friend, or motorcycle rental owner who is not a formally registered motorcycle rental company.  It is evident that AKP Arifin and his teams in Buleleng Regency want to take this a step further and are calling on rental providers to take more responsibility over their rental vehicles and who they lease them out to.  Tourists planning their next visit to Bali and who are planning to hire a motorcycle are being urged to check and double-check the nuances of their travel, health, and driving insurance policies.  Over the last decade, there have been countless cases of tourists in Bali who hopped on a rental moped thinking they were unconditionally covered in the event of a collision. Far too many tourists have learned only when it is too late that a tiny detail on their insurance policy, such as only being covered for moped up to 125cc or needing to have converted their driving licenses into international licenses, means that they will not be covered for their medical bills; many of which have been hundreds of thousands of dollars.  Every policy from every provider and every country is different, and tourists are urged to be super clear about their coverage before making any decisions about driving in Bali, especially this festive season.

        "text_content": "The Acting Governor of Bali, Sang Made Mahendra Jaya, is encouraging tourists to experience more of the traditional Balinese culture.  While visiting temples and trying traditional Balinese food is a popular way for tourists to appreciate the island’s unique heritage, Acting Governor Mahendra Jaya wants to see tourists really dive in deep.  Jembrana Regency has just celebrated the 2023 Makepung Governor’s Cup. The sporting event was attended by Acting Governor Mahendra Jaya and other leading officials. But what is Makepung?  This unique sport has brought anthropologists, journalists, and culture lovers to Bali for decades. The sport is exhibited throughout Indonesia, especially in Java. However, Jembrana Regency is the real home of buffalo racing.  During the sporting season, Makepung races are held across Jembrana Regency every two weeks and always on Sunday. The season culminates in the Makepung Governor’s Cup. Makepung is a serious business and an ancient part of Balinese culture that is still thriving today. Race day is a huge occasion, the water buffalo’s horns are painted and the animals often wear headdresses.  Similar to carriage racing with horses, the Makepung involves racing water buffalo who are pulling a chariot-style cart around a 125m long rice paddle track.  Four jockeys compete at a time with two buffalo pulling each chariot. Racers from the east of the island typically wear red and those from the westerly regions wear green. Though loved by many, Makepung does attract some controversy, similar to the criticisms of horse racing. Speaking to the media during the 2023 Makepung Governor’s Cup, Acting Governor Mahendra Jaya shared, “Apart from being an expression of traditional cultural art that must be preserved, Makepung is also a potential tourist attraction, because of its characteristics and uniqueness that are second to none in Bali and even at the national and international level.” He continued, “The Makepung tradition as an icon and leading tourist attraction of Jembrana Regency has been recognized and recorded as one of the Intangible Natural Cultural Heritage [items for UNSECO].”  A post shared by Mekepung Jembrane (@makepung_jembranaa) “In this regard, we must be able to maintain this award by continuing to strive, commit, and be creative to improve its quality and attractiveness so that it is true, it can really provide benefits.” The promotion of Makepung racing to tourists would certainly go a long way in bringing more tourists to Jembrana Regency.  The area is often overlooked by international tourists in Bali since it covers most of the southwest of the island, sitting over 3-hours away from the major tourist attractions and resorts in Badung Regency. Acting Governor Mahendra Jaya addresses the concern that promoting Makepung racing to tourists in the modern day may be tricky, especially since many organizations are working to eliminate animal entertainment in the tourism industry.  He noted, however, that from the provincial government’s perspective, the preservation and promotion of Makepung racing has benefits in the tourism and cultural sense, as well as a positive impact on the agricultural sector. A post shared by Dayan Wieliam Photography (@dwphotography86) Acting Governor Mahendra Jaya explained that moving forward, Bali must develop more tourism businesses and experiences that create destinations that can compete with other resorts on the island, and around the world; and that this requires a unique edge.  In his view, Makepung racing can help establish villages across Jembrana Regency as tourism destinations that will support community empowerment and boost the economy.  A post shared by Fira Mikael Kwan (@firakwan) It is clear that leaders in the tourism space do want to see Jemrbana and West Bali put on the tourist map.  The Head of the Jembrana Tourism and Culture Service, Anak Agung Komang Sapta Negara, recently told reporters that ticket sales at leading attractions are below target for this time of year.  A post shared by INFORMASI MENARIK SEPUTAR BALI (@sirahbaliinfo) As Jembrana awaits the development of the island’s biggest theme park, the new Paramount Park & Gardens, there is plenty for tourists to explore.  Starting with the West Bali National Park, tourists are encouraged to add the seawater swimming pool in Delodberawah Village, the Gilimanuk Early Human Museum, in addition to Candikusuma Beach, and the majestic Gilimanuk Shiva Statue to their bucket list adventures.  "

        "text_content": "Top officials from Bali Airport have issued apologies to the public following an extortion scandal.  Last week five officers from the Ngurah Rai Immigration Post at Bali Airport were arrested for taking money from tourists to use the fast-track queue upon arrival.  During a stakeholder meeting held on Sunday 19th November the Head of the Ngurah Rai Immigration Office, Suhendra, addressed airport management teams on how to establish greater safeguards and systems to ensure that Bali Airport remains a corruption-free zone. All the major stakeholders were present for the conference, including the Bali Regional Office of the Ministry of Law and Human Rights, Immigration Customs, Quarantine, Region IV Airport Authority, Ngurah Rai Air Force Base, GM Angkasa Pura I, Airport Area Police, and the Bali Provincial Government Protocol Bureau. A post shared by Imigrasi Ngurah Rai (@imngurahrai) Suhendra shared his deepest apologies with the public, especially the Balinese people for transiting the good name of I Gusti Ngurah Rai Airport. He said, “As the Head of the Ngurah Rai Immigration Office, I would like to apologize to the public for this incident.” He continued “And we are fully committed to taking comprehensive and sustainable improvement steps in the future in order to provide the best service to the community.” He added “We and the relevant stakeholders in this meeting agreed to maintain the sterilization of the immigration area.” A post shared by Imigrasi Ngurah Rai (@imngurahrai) “Apart from that, various discussions in this meeting will also be brought to the Facilitation Coordination Meeting (FAL) forum which will be held by the Airport Authority for further handling,” Suhendra revealed, “The investigation process is still ongoing, in principle, we are following all ongoing legal processes, and internally we will also impose sanctions on the officers involved.” A post shared by I Gusti Ngurah Rai Airport (@baliairport) Moving forward, I Gusti Ngurah Rai Airport will be doing more to ensure that queue times are reduced so as to reduce the temptation for officers and tourists to pay their way through the fast track queue that is dedicated for use by VIPs, those with additional needs, the elders and pregnant.  Suhendra is excited about the installation of the 90 new auto gates at Bali Airport, 30 of which will be in place by the end go the year. The automated technology will not be replacing staffed counters but will be managing in addition to fully staffed counters at all times.  He explained “With autogates, all passengers will be required to use autogate during the immigration inspection process. This will make the inspection process run faster and more accurately.” By the end of the installation process, 60 automates will be installed in the arrivals halls and a further 30 in the international departures terminal.  Suhendra and airport management teams also want to see tourists make better use of the e-VOA process. This e-Visa on Arrival system allows tourists to apply, pay for, and acquire their 30-day visa on arrival before they touch down in Bali.  The system is quick and easy to follow online, however, tourists have been repeatedly urged to be careful of counterfeit sites. There is only one official e-VOA site for Indonesian visas and that is https://molina.imigrasi.go.id/ This is the same site that can be used to apply for all kinds of visitors and socio-cultural visas, pre-investment visas, second home visas, and the Golden Visa. It is now the case that tourists can apply for the eVOA for up to five travelers at a time, on the same application; ideal for families and friends traveling together over the festive season.   More tourists using the eVOA service will help travelers cut down their time spent in arrivals dramatically.  Currently, tourists paying for the visa on arrival must queue to pay their IDR 500,000 visa fee, and then move to the immigration queue to be stamped into Indonesia. The e-VOA helps tourists skip the step and makes it quicker for immigration officers to stamp them in.  "

        "date": "2023-11-20 23:46",
        "text_content": "The Acting Governor of Bali, Sang Made Mahendra Jaya, has given more information about the release of Wolbachia mosquitoes in Bali.  The World Mosquito Program has planned to release tens of thousands of mosquitos in Denpasar and Buleleng, but the mission has been postponed indefinitely.  The Acting Governor of Bali has spoken to the public regarding the postponement of the mass release of Wolbachia mosquitoes on the island.  The project, managed by the World Mosquito Program, was established to help reduce the number of dengue cases on the island. The organization is also working in Jogjakarta.  Acting Governor Mahendra Jaya has cited that more socialization and communication is needed before the project can go ahead.  He said, “We need socialization. There is resistance from the community, we don’t want the community to be divided. There are pros and cons, it’s better if we postpone it for now.” It has also been confirmed by the Regional Secretary of Bali Province, Dewa Made Indra, that his party is currently waiting for the study process carried out by the Indonesian Ministry of Health. Indra said, “This includes biotechnology, which means it is good for reducing cases of dengue fever in Denpasar City which are quite high. The only problem is that there has not been a comprehensive study of the use of Wolbachia (mosquitoes), especially with questions from the public.” He confirmed that the Ministry of Health will now investigate the viability of the Wolbachia program in Bali.  The World Mosquito Program states on its website, “The World Mosquito Program has received regulatory approval from relevant government bodies in all the countries where we are releasing Wolbachia mosquitoes. In addition, we don’t release Wolbachia mosquitoes without community support.” A post shared by World Mosquito Program (WMP) (@wmpglobal) Nevertheless, the Ministry of Health will now be conducting further studies of its own based on concerns raised by residents and tourists.  Indra added “The Ministry of Health’s study will include how much the Wolbachia mosquito program will have an effect on reducing cases of dengue fever and how big the chance of this program actually causing new diseases.” “Will dengue fever decrease, but will it cause other diseases? To answer that, of course, science will answer.” The Mayor of Denpasar, I Gusti Ngurah Jaya Negara, told reporters that he too will wait for the report by the Ministry of Health before giving his backing to any further release of Wolbachia mosquitoes.  He explained, “We received a lot of input from the public so that the plan (to spread the Wolbachia mosquito) was postponed.”  A post shared by World Mosquito Program (WMP) (@wmpglobal) “We have not implemented it before actually receiving a recommendation from the Ministry of Health.”Later, it will be carried out if there is a recommendation from the Ministry of Health.”  New data from medical teams in Tabanan Regency in Bali show that dengue cases are soaring.  Data shows that in 2022 there were 366 cases of dengue fever recorded by hospitals in the area, yet by October 28th, 2023 there were 595 cases of dengue fever recorded.  The Head of the Disease Prevention and Control Division of the Tabanan Health Service, Anak Agung Ngurah Putra Wiradana, told reporters that he and his teams are doing all they can to keep residents and tourists safe from dengue fever.  He explained dengue “is an endemic disease in Indonesia, a disease that persists every year. Our prevention efforts, the Tabanan Health Service through community health centers, always carry out health promotions to prevent dengue fever.” “One of them is fogging. Currently fogging is being carried out in areas where there are positive cases of dengue fever.” As monsoon season arrives in Bali the risk of dengue fever increases for everyone on the island.  According to the World Health Organisation, there are a series of easy-to-implement steps to help reduce the risk of contracting dengue fever while in Bali.  WHO recommends wearing loose-fitting clothes that cover as much of the body as possible, using mosquito nets, and using window screens to help keep mosquitos out.  They also recommend people use mosquito repellent, specifically DEET, Picaridin, or IR3535, and use coils or vaporizers.  "

        "text_content": "Bali’s Taro Village is emerging as a must-visit tourist destination.  Located just outside of Ubud the quaint tourism village has recently been named amongst the best in the world by the United Nations World Tourism Organisation.  At this year’s United National World Tourism Awards, two of Bali’s tourism villages won the prestigious title of best Tourism Village in the World.  The first was the iconic Penglipuran Village in Bangli Regency, the second was Desa Taro in Ginayar. In fact, Indonesia was one of the biggest winners at the awards as Bilebante Village in Nusa Tenggara Barat and Pela Village in East Kalimantan also received top marks for their tourism offerings.  Taro Village is currently preparing to welcome a huge influx of visitors over the festive season. In December Bali is set to welcome over one million tourists the vast majority top whom will visit during the Christmas and New Year holidays.  A post shared by Dinas Pariwisata Kabupaten Gianyar (@gianyar_tourism) Speaking to reporters Chairman of the Taro Tourism Village Tourism Awareness Group, I Wayan Gede Ardika, said that the community is working together to have everything looking spic-and-span for the festive season.  He shared “Looking at the trend, it is possible that tourist visits will increase. The goal is so that tourists can enjoy the atmosphere safely and comfortably.” A post shared by Pesona Desa Nusantara (@pesonadesaid) He revealed that in 2022, the number of tourists visiting Taro Village was 15,707 but the figures in 2023 will read much higher.  Taro Village, together with Tampaksiring Village and Sudaji and Pemuteran Villages in collaboration with the Indonesian Hotel and Restaurant Association (PHRI) Bali to create tour packages and elevate tourism experiences for visitors.  A post shared by Greenbike Adventure Bali (@greenbiketour) Together they want to put village tourism on the map in Bali and showcase the best of rural tourism to the world.  Ardika added the collaboration is in place “So that promotions become more massive so that tourist visits will increase. The hope, of course, is that the direct impact of tourism can be felt directly by village communities.” There is such a lot to explore in Taro Village, and for tourists wishing to have a truly authentic homestay experience Taro Village is the place to stay. Lembu Putih Farm Stay is one of the most popular guesthouses in the village and guests are spoilt with stunning views of the surrounding jungle and farmland.  Guests are also invited to stay at Komang Petak Homestay, Jero Mangku Gede House, and Made Bidel Homestay each of which is run by families who have lived in the village for generations. For those planning a day trip to Taro Village, it is most easily accessed from Ubud which sits just 40 minutes away by drive.  Taro Village provides tourists with an incredible opportunity to learn more about local art, culture, and history.  There are dozens of different activities and workshops on offer. Guests can hire traditional Balinese clothing and have a private photoshoot against the village’s most beautiful backdrops.  For something a little more adventurous and adrenaline-fueled tourists can book in the round of paintball or head out into the jungle on ATV.  Food lovers find themselves right at home in Taro Village. Proudly showcasing classic Balinese and Indonesian dishes, the locally run warungs in Taro Village are not to be missed.  Warung Semara Ratih is a popular house and their nasi goreng gets a thumbs up all round.  An experience not to be missed in Taro Village is a visit to The Fireflies Garden. Tours of the garden give tourists the chance to learn about traditional agricultural practices.  The most magical package on offer is the ‘See Firefly’ package. Tourists are invited to join an early evening walk around the rice paddies to see fireflies light up the landscape.  "

Biaya pemakaian dua bulan yang kini jadi tunggakan itu mencapai Rp 10 juta. Padahal, para pegawai di kantor itu hanya menggunakan air untuk menyiram air kencing di toilet.Para staf di kantor itupun harus rela tak menggunakan air di kantor lantaran sambungannya bakal disegel. Maklum, Kesbangpol Bangli sudah tak punya anggaran lagi untuk membayar tunggakan karena hanya dijatah Rp 100 ribu per bulan dalam setahun untuk biaya air.Baca juga: Sopir Minibus Maut yang Tewaskan Enam Pemedek Jadi Tersangka\"Masa dalam satu bulan pemakaian air 800 kubik? Baru akan bayar, staf saya kaget bulan September kena hampir Rp 9 juta yang biasanya bayar cuma Rp 60 ribuan sebulan,\" tutur Kirmanjaya, Selasa (21/11/2023).Kata dia, tagihan air pada September mencapai Rp 8,7 juta. Ada juga tagihan pada Oktober sebesar Rp 1,1 juta termasuk denda dan biaya lainnya. Sehingga, total tunggakan air itu mencapai Rp 10 juta. Ia pun rela jika PDAM Bangli memilih penyegelan sebagai jalan terakhir.\"Bayar juga sudah tidak bisa. Kalau disegel sudah alternatif, ya sudah. Kan nggak mungkin saya pribadi yang bayar. Logika kami, staf hanya ke toilet, maaf, hanya kencing. Mandi sudah di rumah, menyiram apalagi, nggak ada kegiatan lain di sini,\" imbuh Kirmanjaya.Menurut dia, PDAM Bangli seharusnya mengonfirmasi dulu jika menemukan pemakaian tidak wajar sebelum memasukkannya sebagai tagihan. Ia pun akan bersurat dan berkoordinasi lebih lanjut dengan PDAM Bangli.\"Saya sempat minta klarifikasi ke PDAM datang ke kantor. Patokannya hanya hasil cek di sistem aplikasinya. Saya tanya, katanya (sambungan) bocor. Kok banyak sekali? Berapa sih besar bocornya? Sempat dulu bocor tapi sudah disambung, itu kecil,\" ungkap dia.Direktur PDAM Bangli Dewa Gede Ratno Suparso Mesi menjelaskan tagihan yang tiba-tiba membengkak itu diduga akibat ada instalasi dalam di kantor setempat yang bocor. Ia membantah adanya kesalahan sistem maupun meteran air.\"Sebelumnya ada klaim kesalahan meteran, tapi bukan itu. Kami bisa pertanggungjawabkan itu. Ada bocor di dalam,\" jelas Suparso Mesi saat dikonfirmasi detikBali, Selasa malam.Baca juga: Teriakan Histeris Penumpang Minibus Sebelum 6 Nyawa Melayang di KarangasemSuparso menjelaskan penerapan denda dan sanksi penyegelan tetap berlaku meski terhadap kantor pemerintah.

        "description": "Daftar IsiBantah Ada Instruksi Coret Foto Jokowi di Baliho Ganjar-MahfudUngkit Lagi Manipulasi Hukum di MKBeda Sikap PDIP ke Gibran dan BobbyDenpasar - Ketua Umum (Ketum) PDI Perjuangan Megawati Soekarnoputri memimpin rapat konsolidasi PDIP Bali di Sanur, Denpasar, Rabu (23/11/2023). Pertemuan yang digelar secara tertutup tersebut dihadiri kader PDIP dari tingkat ranting hingga cabang se-Bali.Sekjen PDIP Hasto Kristiyanto membeberkan beberapa hasil rapat konsolidasi tersebut. Salah satunya terkait instruksi kepada kader untuk turun ke bawah alias turba memenangkan Ganjar Pranowo-Mahfud Md pada Pemilihan Presiden (Pilpres) 2024.\"Partai ini instruksinya tunggal, turun ke bawah menangkan PDI Perjuangan dan Pak Ganjar-Mahfud,\" tegas Hasto seusai rapat konsolidasi.Baca juga: Hasto Ungkap Rencana Pertemuan Puan dan Jokowi, Bahas Posisi di PDIP?Hasto optimistis kader PDIP di Bali semakin solid untuk memenangkan Ganjar-Mahfud pada Pilpres tahun depan. Menurutnya, solidaritas kader PDIP semakin menguat setelah baliho Ganjar-Mahfud dicopot beberapa waktu lalu. Bahkan, ia menilai militansi kader PDIP di Bali sangat tinggi.Tanpa menyebut angka, Hasto mengungkapkan partainya menargetkan perolehan suara Ganjar-Mahfud di Bali lebih tinggi dari raihan suara pasangan Joko Widodo (Jokowi) dan Ma'ruf Amin pada Pilpres 2019. \"Target ini telah disampaikan kepada Megawati yang menunjukkan bahwa optimisme seluruh kader partai yang menyatu dengan rakyat untuk memenangkan Ganjar-Mahfud,\" jelasnya.Bantah Ada Instruksi Coret Foto Jokowi di Baliho Ganjar-MahfudSejumlah baliho caleg PDIP di kawasan Kota Denpasar tak lagi memajang foto Presiden Jokowi. Padahal, potret mantan Gubernur DKI Jakarta itu awalnya kerap bersanding dengan foto Megawati dan Bung Karno pada baliho caleg PDIP.Hal itu juga terpantau di Mataram, NTB. Baliho-baliho PDIP NTB yang sebelumnya menampilkan foto Jokowi diapit oleh Bung Karno dan Megawati, lengkap dengan foto capres PDIP Ganjar Pranowo. Namun, seusai pendaftaran resmi capres-cawapres, baliho-baliho yang menampilkan foto Jokowi itu diturunkan.Baca juga: Hasto Bantah Ada Instruksi PDIP 'Coret' Jokowi dari Baliho Ganjar-MahfudHasto membantah adanya instruksi dari DPP PDIP soal pencoretan gambar Jokowi dari baliho partai, baik caleg hingga baliho Ganjar-Mahfud. Dia menegaskan PDIP akan berjuang untuk memenangkan Ganjar-Mahfud bersama partai koalisi lainnya seperti PPP, Hanura, dan Perindo, serta relawan-relawan.\"Tidak ada perintah-perintah gitu. Baliho cerminan suara rakyat,\" tegas Hasto.Hasto kemudian memuji militansi kader PDIP di Bali sangat tinggi. Menurutnya, Bali merupakan salah satu provinsi yang memiliki rekam jejak PDIP yang sangat kuat, mulai dari Bung Karno hingga Megawati.Hasto menilai dukungan warga Bali terhadap PDIP merupakan kekuatan yang ikhlas. Ia mencontohkan Yenny Wahid yang mendukung Ganjar-Mahfud karena dukungan secara ikhlas. \"Pasangan Ganjar-Mahfud ini adalah pasangan ikhlas, tanpa manipulasi hukum, tanpa intimidasi, tanpa menciptakan kontroversi, bahkan ijazahnya jelas,\" tandas Hasto.Ungkit Lagi Manipulasi Hukum di MKHasto juga kembali mengungkit dugaan manipulasi hukum di Mahkamah Konstitusi (MK) yang kemudian memuluskan langkah Gibran Rakabuming menjadi cawapres Prabowo Subianto. Menurut dia, rekayasa hukum itu memunculkan masalah-masalah baru.Dia menyebut manipulasi hukum di MK terjadi karena hubungan kekerabatan Jokowi dengan Anwar Usman. Mantan Ketua MK itu diketahui merupakan ipar Jokowi, yang belakangan diputus melanggar etik berat.\"Menggunakan hubungan kekerabatan dengan pamannya (untuk memanipulasi hukum di MK). Maka mengapa untuk menjadi pemimpin syarat-syarat etika dan moral itu sangat penting,\" tegas Hasto.Disinggung terkait sejumlah survei yang menyebut elektabilitas Ganjar-Mahfud masih di bawah Prabowo-Gibran, Hasto kembali menyindir soal hukum sebagai alat untuk menegakkan keadilan.\"Pak Ganjar dan Pak Mahfud itu jauh di atas yang lain (elektabilitasnya) dalam komitmen terhadap rakyat. Maka bisa blusukan tidak melakukan rekayasa hukum, jadi menggunakan hukum sebagai alat untuk menegakkan keadilan. Itu di atas,\" jelasnya.Beda Sikap PDIP ke Gibran dan BobbySebelum mengikuti konsolidasi PDIP di Denpasar, Hasto sebelumnya mendampingi Megawati di acara Conference of the AFEO (CAFEO) Ke-41 di Nusa Dua, Badung. Dalam acara tersebut, Megawati menerima penghargaan tertinggi dari federasi untuk organisasi profesi keinsinyuran se-ASEAN (AFEO).Seusai mendampingi Presiden Indonesia ke-5 itu, Hasto mengungkap alasan PDIP memecat Bobby Nasution dari kader partai. Ia menegaskan Bobby dipecat dari PDIP karena menyalahi aturan dengan mendukung Prabowo-Gibran.Baca juga: Dibantah Cak Imin, Hasto Ngotot Klaim Ada Komunikasi soal Tekanan Kekuasaan\"Mas Bobby memberikan dukungan (Prabowo-Gibran), konstitusi yang melarang itu. Sehingga otomatis keanggotaannya di PDI Perjuangan dengan statusnya itu gugur secara otomatis. Jadi itu yang terjadi,\" ungkap Hasto di Nusa Dua, Rabu.Gibran, lanjut Hasto, berbeda dengan Bobby. Menurutnya, Gibran yang sudah menjadi calon wakil presiden (cawapres) Prabowo Subianto telah melalui suatu proses yang saat ini masih menimbulkan banyak kontroversi. \"Dan menimbulkan persoalan etika serta manipulasi hukum,\" imbuhnya.Hasto membantah sikap PDIP terhadap Gibran tidak tegas seperti sikap ke Bobby. Ia justru menyinggung konstitusi sudah di atas aturan partai. \"Ya konstitusi itu lebih tegas di atas peraturan, di atas segalanya,\" ujarnya. \"Megawati: Mahfud Md Pendekar Hukum dan Pembela Wong Cilik\"[Gambas:Video 20detik](iws/iws)pdip megawati ganjar-mahfud hasto kristiyanto pilpres 2024"
