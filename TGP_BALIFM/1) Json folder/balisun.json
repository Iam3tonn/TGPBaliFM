        "text_content": "Bali is celebrating the opening of a new one-stop lifestyle destination in the vibing resort of Canggu.  The Luc Lifestyle in the heart of Berawa, Canggu, is set to become a fast new favorite hangout for tourists, expats, and locals alike.  The Luc Lifestyle is a one-stop lifestyle destination that features restaurants, shops, and so much more.  Branded as ‘casual elegance,’ The Luc Lifestyle has combined modern luxury and traditional Balinese design elements throughout the complex. Speaking at the soft opening on Thursday 23rd November, Anthon Hilman, the CEO of The Luc, said “The Luc is more than just a destination; This is a journey of the spirit of Indonesian culture packaged exclusively in the luxury of the modern world.”  Soft opening events are happening throughout the weekend and have kicked off to a fiery start. Thursday’s celebration saw traditional Balinese dancers and top local music artists all grace the stage.  A post shared by The Luc (@theluc.id_lifestyle) The complex has plenty to keep visitors entertained. The Luc features an in-house spa that will offer treatments from the Mustika Ratu brand, in addition to a state-of-the-art gym, yoga center, dynamic co-working space, and basement parking that can accommodate up to 50 four-wheeled vehicles. The soft opening celebration was attended by the Head of Tibubeneng Village, I Made Kamajaya, who was delighted to welcome the new lifestyle center to the Bereawa business community.  Kamajaya said, “Hopefully the soft opening will bring blessings I am happy to have The Luc [and am] grateful that Tibubeneng was chosen and became an investment choice.” A post shared by The Luc (@theluc.id_lifestyle) Kamajaya did acknowledge that having another lifestyle center and day club in the area will increase traffic flowing through the village.  However, he confirmed that more community security officers will be stationed throughout Berawa 24/7 to help keep traffic flowing freely.  A post shared by The Luc (@theluc.id_lifestyle) Visitors heading to The Luc have a lot to look forward to. The shops in the courtyard include classic Balinese and international brands, Uluwatu Lace, Camani, and Luzige.  There is a dining option galore, Kori Restaurant serves up stunning Indonesian specialties, as well as a wonderful menu of delicious signature dishes from Monsieur Spoon.  The shopping continues at Pia Agung and of course, Coco Lite offers solutions to all those on-the-go needs.  The arrival of The Luc Lifestyle in Berawa shows that there is increasing demand and interest for day clubs and one-stop lifestyle complexes in Bali. Just a 2-minute drive from The Luc is Atlas Beach Fest which is Bali’s biggest beach club.  A post shared by Atlas Beach Club (@atlasbeachclub) Atlas Beach Fest, which opened in 2022, has fast become Bali’s favorite one-stop lifestyle center. The complex features the now world-famous beach club, a shopping center, a community events space, and a food court.  While some have condemned the rapid commercialization of Canggu, it seems that leaders and thousands of tourists are in support of these kinds of developments in Bali.  Speaking in July ahead of the one-year anniversary of Atalss Beach Club’s opening, Kamajaya told reporters how he feels the development of the beach club has been a positive thing for the island as a whole.  Kamajaya said, “As the head of the village in Tibubeneng, where Atlas is located, we are very happy because this business that has been established in our village has become one of the best destinations in the world.” He added, “Atlas has indeed had a very positive impact economically, both directly and indirectly.” Atlas Beach Club may be able to boast that it is the world’s biggest beach club and is home to the world’s longest pool bar, but competition in Canggu is tough and everyone is trying to up their game.  A new apartment complex that is under construction in Berawa will feature the world’s longest rooftop pool once completed. The Magnum Residence Berawa is a luxury apartment complex boasting five-star service and uninterrupted ocean views.  "

        "text_content": "Construction work is underway in Bali’s popular resort of Canggu to build a new shortcut road that will help alleviate some of the ever-increasing traffic in the area.  The new Simpang Padonan Road, which is also being referred to as the Tibubeneng-Canggu-Dalung intersection, will help mitigate traffic congestion and there are hopes the project will be completed in the middle of the festive season.  Traffic congestion along the Tibubeneng-Canggu Highway is intense. Videos circulate online every week of gridlocked traffic entering the resort of Canggu every day.  It’s safe to say that any tourists who have visited Canggu in the last few months have expertness or at the very least caught a glimpse of the traffic issue in the area. Traffic congestion has been affecting the tour’s experience of the island and causing frustration for local people too.  Speaking to reporters this week, project supervisors Gusti Ngurah Danu and Ketut Antara, confirmed that the new shortcut can be completed quickly since there the road is only 334m.  The road is 8m wide, and construction includes sidewalks. Speaking on Friday 24th November, Antara said “Project progress is increasing. For yesterday, we are targeting 1.2% but in the field, it is already 2%.” The project still has a long way to go but teams are confident that work will be completed on time. Backfilling soil and comparing the limestone is already completed.  Antara said “The work was carried out by PT Budi Aluh and Project Consultants from CV Dwi Duta Design. “According to the contract, the work period is 56 calendar days, completed on December 28th, 2023.” With the project set for completion on the 28th of December, just in time for New Year’s Eve, only some of the huge influx of tourists arriving for the festive season will be able to benefit from the new road.  Travel data shared by the Indonesian government this week shows that over 102 million Indonesian people will be traveling over the Christmas holidays, with a considerable percentage heading to Bali.  This huge influx of tourists is in addition to the high increase in international arrivals who start flying in as of the 19th and 20th, ready for Christmas in Bali.  The new Simpang Padonan Road shortcut will help traffic flowing along the Tibubeneng-Canggu Highway but there are concerns that this new road alone won’t be sufficient in resolving Canggu’s congestion issues.  The new shortcut will help keep traffic flowing along the highway, but the impacts of this won’t stop traffic congestion closer to the beaches or along existing shortcuts.  Furthermore, the new Simpang Padonan Road comes with a new set of one-way traffic rules at the intersection that will take time to become the new normal.  This could be an issue if previous changes in traffic flow are anything to go by. Earlier this year a concrete bollard was installed at one end of the Umalas-Berawa shortcut, also known as Gang Batu Sari.  The concrete bollard makes the shortcut impassable for cars but accessible for motorcycles. Since the concrete bollard was installed on only one side, cars still attempted to use the shortcut only to discover they had to reverse all the way back up the single-track lane, causing more congestion and frustration on the roads.  Nevertheless, any improvements to Canggu’s roads will be well-received by locals and tourists. The new road is just one of many notable road improvement projects that are underway in Bali at the moment and in the coming months.  Big news broke this week regarding the Gilimanuk-Medewi Toll Road. The new toll road will connect the central-south of the island to the west.  Though not immediate of value to tourists, who mostly stay in the Badung Regency. The Gilimanuk-Medewi Toll Road is set to provide better connectivity to the west of Bali, in part to help make it easier for tourists to explore more of what the area has to offer.  Although the first stone was laid last year, progress on the project has been slow. Due to funding issues, the project is now up for tender again, but officials hope that construction work can be picked up again in early 2024.  "

        "text_content": "Bali’s I Gusti Ngurah Rai International Airport has confirmed that 4 major international airlines will be adding new flight services to the schedule.  Starting from 1st December airlines based in China and India will be making it easier than ever for tourists to visit the Island of the Gods.  The General Manager of I Gusti Ngurah Rai International Airport, Handy Heryudhitiawan, has confirmed to reporters that four big airlines will be increasing flight availability to Denpasar.  He said “This information is that in early December 2023, there will be the addition of Xiamen Airlines; they are adding flights from cities in China. Bali is still being targeted by international airlines; this is extraordinary momentum.” A post shared by Vistara (@vistara) Xiamen Airlines will be adding more direct flights to Bali from China, and Vistara and IndiGo will be increasing their services, too, with more details to be confirmed shortly.  Finally, Etihad Airways, based out of the United Arab Emirates, will soon feature more frequently on the weekly flight schedule.  Heryudhitiawan added, “This is proof that the market in Bali is still strong because there are several airlines that are also planning to change the type of aircraft to a larger size.”  At present, I Gusti Ngurah Rai International Airport is served by 36 airlines across 30 international routes. In terms of domestic travel, thirteen airlines are covering 19 domestic routes across the archipelago.  A post shared by Etihad Airways (@etihad) On 1st December, Vistara will launch a new daily service between New Delhi and Denpasar.  The long-anticipated first direct flight between Bali and India has been praised by tourism leaders as the first and most important step in increasing the bond between the two majority Hindu destinations.  For travelers closer to Bali, in Australia specifically, travel to the Island of the Gods just became heaps easier too, and it’s a sign to get better still.  Earlier this month, Batik Air launched the direct Adelaide-Bali flight service.  The service from Adelaide means that tourists from eight Australian cities can now fly directly to Bali; Brisbane, Cairns, Darwin, Gold Coast, Melbourne, Sydney, and Perth. A new Canberra-Bali flight with Batik Air is due to launch in March 2024. A post shared by Batik Air (@batikair) Bali Airport is busy; the terminals service an overage of 65,000 passengers a day across 400 aircraft movements.  Heryudhitiawan has also confirmed that Emirates has submitted a request to increase its Airbus A380 service. The Airbus A380 is the biggest commercial aircraft in the world and is already landing daily in Bali.  Heryudhitiawan explained, “On June 1st, 2023, Bali made history as the first airport in Indonesia to land the largest Airbus in the world and operated to this day with a good load factor. And then the issue is that they [Emirates] want to ask for additional slots.”  Now, Heryudhitiawan and his teams are working to scale the capacity of the airport to accommodate soaring demand for travel to Bali.  News that four airlines are increasing their flight services to Bali is good news for tourists around the world, especially those planning long-haul trips to Bali.  Increased flight availability out of transit hubs in India and the United Arab Emirates means that tourists have more choice when it comes to a layover.  These four airlines are not alone in fact, on Sunday the Indonesian Minister for Tourism and Creative Economies, Sanidaga Uno, confirmed that even more airlines are making applications to increase flight services across Indonesia, including in Bali. Minister Uno said that Garuda Indonesia, Citilink, Batik Air, Lion Air, Super Air Jet, and Air Asia have all submitted requests for additional flight services in December.  Travelers planning their next trip to Bali should be on the lookout for travel deals in the next couple of weeks.  Flight prices have already started to fluctuate ahead of the Christmas and New Year holidays. These next two weeks are usually the cheapest flights will be before the inevitable hike in fares as demand soars.  "

        "date": "23 November 2023 23:54",
        "text_content": "Indonesia’s Minister for Tourism and Creative Economies has issued a statement calling on tour guides in Bali to practice more caution and attention to safety when working with guests on the island.  Minster Uno’s comments come after a Brazilian tourist died in Bali after tackling a challenging coastal hike.  Minister Sandiaga Uno, has issued his response to the news that a 56-year-old Brazilian tourist died in Nusa Penida late last week.  The man, known only by his initials AC, collapsed in a public restroom after completing the challenging hike down and back to the world-famous Kelingking Beach.  Minster Uno addressed tour guides in his show The Weekly Brief with Sandi Uno. He said, “We have not seen the conditions for visiting being tightened. However, we want tour guides to ensure that tourists are healthy and that their death is in God’s hands.”  He called on tour guides across the country but especially in Bali to ensure that tourists have excellent conditions when traveling.  He wants tour guides to become more proficient in reading tourists’ needs and abilities, like climbing stairs or taking a long journey. He noted that tour guides should assess “what features or parts of tourism activities might be tiring.” According to local reports, AC and his 54-year-old wife decided to tackle the challenging descent down to Kelingking Beach in Nusa Penida despite their guide’s advice not to due to the limited amount of time available during their day trip.  The cliffside hike down to Kelingking Beach is notoriously dangerous. The hike has claimed the lives of several tourists over the years and injured countless more.  Police have issued statements following AC’s passing. Nusa Penida Police Chief Commissioner Ida Bagus Putra Sumerta told reporters that AC and his wife were on a day trip to Nusa Penida and arrived at Banjar Nyuh Habor on the 9.30 am fast boat.  The couple met their tour guide and driver for the day, Kadek Pramerta, who took them directly to the Kelingking Beach clifftop lookout.  According to Pramerta, the couple insisted on doing the hike despite his advice not to. Following the hike the couple went to the public bathrooms and Pramerta waited for them in the car park.  Concerned that they were taking a long time, he went to check on them, where he learned that AC had lost consciousness.  Pramerta is reported to have called an ambulance which swiftly arrived, however, paramedics declared him dead at the scene. AC’s wife has confirmed to the police that he had a known history of heart disease.  While Minster Uno wants to see tour guides take more proactive and assertive steps in keeping tourists safe, many would agree that tourists must also exercise caution and take as much responsibility as possible for their own health and safety while on vacation. Nusa Penida has been called out dozens of times this year for not prioritizing public safety. This has led to officials committing to putting improved safeguards in place for tourists.  In July this year, the Head of the Klungkung Tourism Office, Ni Made Sulistiawati, confirmed that more officers would be deployed to help steward the island’s leading attractions and natural wonders.  Speaking in August, the Regent of Klungkung, I Nyoman Suwirta, confirmed that Nusa Penida will receive the level of investment it requires to keep up with tourist demand, including improving transportation and safety infrastructure.  Tragically reports of tourists becoming injured or even losing their lives in Nusa Penida follow a very similar set of events.  The most common cause of injury or death in Nusa Penida occurs at Kelingking Beach.  Earlier this year a temporary swimming ban was put in place to help protect tourists from the dangerous current and high waves that have dragged dozens of tourists out to sea.  The second most frequent disaster in Nusa Penida is tourists falling from clifftops, especially at Kelingking Beach, Diamond Beach, and Broken Beach.  Tourists heading to Bali at any time are reminded to keep their awareness about them as they pose for photos on the precarious clifftops of Nusa Penida.  "

        "text_content": "Bali is booming with development projects, from new hotels to new apartment complexes and beyond. Around every corner and in every resort town new properties are being built.  One apartment complex in particular is set to boast the world’s longest rooftop pool. Magnum Estate is the property development company behind the Magum Residence Berawa. The project, which is already underway, will feature luxury apartments and five-star service.  Overlooking Canggu’s most iconic beach, the Magnum Residence Berawa is touted to feature a “rooftop that has no equals in the world.”  A post shared by Magnum Estate – Real Estate Developer in Bali (@magnum.estate) Mock-ups of what the site will look like at completion show a modern, angular building, with a luxuriously furnished rooftop and a long infinity pool that runs the full length of the apartment building; a whopping 190m.  The site sits just 500m from Berawa Beach and is within a short drive of all of Canggu’s world-famous beach clubs, emerging fine dining scene, and independent boutiques.  The Magnum Residence Berawa is set for completion in the last quarter of 2025, so tourists and expats have some time to wait before they can jump into the world’s longest rooftop pool.  The apartment complex will feature one-bedroom apartments, starting at USD 350,000, and two-bedroom apartments, for USD 590,000; all of which overlook the ocean. A post shared by Magnum Estate – Real Estate Developer in Bali (@magnum.estate) The property is appealing to property investors and those looking to establish a second home in Bali since Magnum Residence Berawa has said that apartment owners can rent out their property, reside in it themselves, or use it as a vacation home that’s available at any time.  Canggu is easily the most busy tourist resort in Bali right now. The iconic surf destination is bustling with tourists from all over the world.  The evolution of Canggu as a destination has happened at lightning speed, even in light of the pandemic. Less than ten years ago Canggu was a quiet Balinese village, home to a few expats, and frequented by surfers.  Then came the more adventurous backpackers and digital nomads, followed by the holidaymakers seeking something a little off the beaten track. For many, Canggu has become the party capital of South East Asia.  A post shared by Vilas Boas Invest (@vilasboasinvest) The Magnum Residence Berawa is just one of hundreds of major building projects underway in Bali right now. Magnum Estate as a company is also developing huge complexes in Sanur, Seminyak, Umalas, and the Bukit Peninsula.  Such huge amounts of investment into tourism accommodation and investment properties have been celebrated by some as a sign of positive economic development in Bali.  But just as many Bali lovers have been vocal in their concerns that the level of development is unsustainable.  Earlier this year the community in Seseh successfully petitioned against the construction of a massive apartment and holiday villa complex.  The community, of local residents, ex-pats, and regular visitors to the surf village, all came together to call out the potentially destructive nature of the project.  The development company has said they’re going back to the drawing board to ensure that projects take on board the opinions and advice of the local authorities and the local community.  Down in Uluwatu, the community is also banding together to call out the rapid development of apartment complexes that they feel are spoiling the natural charm of the coastal retreat.  The group Stop Uluwatu Destruction has been working to establish awareness to help “stop the Cangguization and destruction of Uluwatu.” All this development does mean that Bali is becoming a tourist destination that can boast the world’s first and only in many categories.  The island is also home to the world’s biggest beach club, which itself is home to the world’s longest poolside bar.  Atlas Beach Club, also in Canggu, is one of the most popular beach club venues in Bali. The complex only opened its doors in 2022 but has quickly become the go-to party destination in the area.  "

        "text_content": "Tourists traveling to Bali in the coming weeks are being urged to be vigilant about the risk of rabies.  This news comes after two more residents were bitten by a dog that has gone on to test positive for rabies. Humans can contract rabies by being bitten by animals that carry the virus, such as dogs and monkeys.  There are tens of thousands of dogs in Bali. Many are pet or community-owned dogs, and some are strays.  The provincial and regency governments have solid programs in place to help prevent the spread of rabies.  Free mass vaccination clinics for dogs are held on a regular basis throughout the island, and at the busiest monkey temples, the wild troops of monkeys are also regularly vaccinated against rabies.  However, there has been an increasing number of reports of both residents and tourists getting bitten by dogs and monkeys.  It has been made public that two residents who live near Keramas Beach were bitten by the same rabies-positive dog on the same day.  The pair are receiving anti-rabies vaccination treatment. With this in mind, tourists heading to Bali are reminded to check their rabies vaccination status and take suitable precautions to mitigate the risk of a bite.  From the Bali side, a Rabies Alert Team will be deployed across the capital to help suppress transmission. The Head of the Denpasar City Agriculture Service, AA Bayu Brahmasta, has called for all stakeholders to take an even more proactive approach to tackling rabies in Bali.  He told reporters “The Rabies Alert Team will be tasked with providing education and outreach to the community.”  A post shared by Bali Animal Welfare Assoc. (@bawabali_official) The Rabies Alert Team will operate primarily in Denpasar though localised rabies response teams are in operation throughout the regencies, as well as animal welfare organisations like BAWA who also do work to vaccinate animals and educate communities.  Brahmasta added “The Denpasar City Agriculture Service is maximizing [the work of] the Rabies Alert Team. This team is tasked with providing education to the public to minimize the spread of rabies and minimize the incident of bite victims.” According to Brahmasta, there are 82,195 known rabies-transmitting animals in Denpasar City alone, with vaccination coverage of over 70%.  However, an islandwide rabies vaccination shortage is proving a concern for both humans and animals.  On Monday 20th November the Head of Disease Prevention and Control for Denpasar City, Dr. Anak Agung Ngurah Gede Dharmayuda, called on the public not to panic amid the anti-rabies vaccination shortage.  It is not only in Denpasar City where there is a storage of anti-rabies vaccines. In Buleleng Regency, this week’s stock sits at just 300 doses.  The Head of the Buleleng District Health Service, Dr. Sucipto, said that he and his teams are prioritizing high-risk bite cases given the shortage.  Dr Sucipto told reporters “Previously there was some leeway in the policy of giving anti-rabies vaccine, but after the availability became minimal, we made a more selective process of vaccines and gave them to high-risk bite cases.” On average, Buleleng Regency alone sees four bite cases every day.  The shortage of anti-rabies vaccine in Bali is being felt by tourists. Last week an Australian mother on vacation told reporters of their ordeal after her 10-year-old daughter was bitten by a monkey at the Ubud Sacred Monkey Forest.  Amanda Tabone told reporters that she was turned away from one hospital that told her they had no anti-rabies vaccination in stock.  Tabone had to contact her insurance providers in Australia in order to track down a hospital with vaccine supplies.  Her caught did receive a course of anti-rabies vaccinations, immunoglobin treatment, and herpes medication as a precaution following the bite.  "

There is also an island-wide initiative to integrate traditional medicine and healing with modern scientific medicine practices. It is all part of a bigger move to promote cultural, sustainable tourism to international visitors by way of encouraging them to stay longer and spend more on vacation. "

        "text_content": "Travelers planning to spend Christmas and New Year in Bali may be in for a shock if they look at ticket prices this week.  As the Indonesian Central Statistics Agency and Ministry for Transport reveal new travel figures ahead of the Christmas holidays, airlines appear to be hiking their prices.  Just last week the Indonesian Minster for Tourism and Creative Economies, Sanidaga Uno, confirmed to reporters that airports and airlines across the country will be putting on more flights to meet increased demand for travel this festive season. Speaking to reporters during a visit to Yogyakarta, Minister Uno shared “With the increase in the number of flights and the availability of seats, the supply will increase, and at Christmas and New Year we hope that airline ticket prices will be stable and affordable.” This was a hope echoed by many tourists, domestic and international. However, this week some Bali flights have soared in price, while others have been heavily discounted. It’s time to get scouring the flight search engines!  With Black Friday deals already live for some airlines, travelers are already searching for deals.  A post shared by Imigrasi Ngurah Rai (@imngurahrai) The Ministry of Transportation and the Transportation Policy Agency has published the results of a nationwide survey of domestic travelers and their travel plans for the Christmas and New Year holidays this year.  I Gusti Ngurah Rai International Airport will be the busiest airport in the country, alongside Soekarno Hatta Airport in Jakarta.  Latest travel deals show that the cheapest one-way direct flight tickets between the capital Jakarta and Bali cost between IDR 985,000 and IDR 1 million for economy class sets with Air Asia, Super Air Jet, and Pelita Air, starting from 19th December.  Throughout the rest of the year, flights between the two cities are considerably lower, especially when booked in advance.  A post shared by Fly AirAsia (@flyairasia) In terms of international flights, the fluctuations in ticket prices have not yet been too significant. In fact, for tourists planning long-haul journeys to Bali, Garuda Indonesia may just be worth checking out.  The country’s national carrier is hosting the Garuda Indonesia International Travel Fair (GATF) event online and in partnership with travel agents.  Discounts of up to 80% are featured in the travel deals to leading destinations in Indonesia from Hong Kong, Singapore, and Seoul. For tens of thousands of long-haul travelers to Bali, a layover in Hong Kong, Singapore, Bangkok or Kuala Lumpur is necessary.  For those traveling between now and November 25th, 2024, it might be worth spending some time scrolling for deals.  It may be possible to snap up a round-trip flight from Bali to Singapore, Hong Kong, or Seoul and then book the first/last leg of the long-haul trip on a separate booking.  A post shared by Garuda Indonesia | The Airline of Indonesia (@garuda.indonesia) Speaking to reporters Garuda Indonesia President Director Irfaniaputra said “Optimizing various peak season periods at the end of the year and in 2024, it is hoped that this GATF International event can optimize the level of foreign tourist visits to Indonesia through the availability of attractive offers to enjoy the end of year holidays in various destinations in Indonesia via direct flights from Hong Kong, Singapore and Seoul.” Infraniaputra concluded In addition to accommodating the increasingly competitive accessibility of flight services for international passengers, we hope that holding the 2023 International GATF can be momentum in itself in encouraging the growth of international tourist movements towards Indonesia.” What is clear is that Bali will be busy this Christmas and New Year holiday. Last year, over one million tourists arrived on the island for the holidays.  The Indonesian Minister of Transportation Budi Karya Sumadi, has confirmed that over 107 million Indonesian tourists will be traveling domestically this festive season.  A survey has shown that 45% of domestic travelers are planning to visit major tourist destinations in Indonesia, such as Bali. The atmosphere in Bali over the Christmas and New Year period is always buzzing and celebratory. Although Bali is a majority Balinese Hindu province, within the majority Muslim nation of Indonesia, Christmas is widely celebrated. "

        "text_content": "Indonesia is the largest majority Muslim nation in the world, but that doesn’t mean that Christmas is just another day of the week.  Nationwide there are over 29 million Christians who celebrate the festive season, and although Bali is a majority Balinese Hindu province, Christmas is a big deal on the Island of the Gods.  Data revealed this week by the Ministry of Transportation through the Transportation Policy Agency gives a solid indication of how many people in Indonesia are planning to travel over the Christmas and New Year period.  While it may come as no surprise that I Gusti Ngurah Rai International Airport will be one of the best transportation hubs over the two-week period, the sheer number of people on the move is a lot to wrap your head around.  Survey results reveal that it is anticipated that the potential for community and domestic tourist movement will reach 107.63 million people or 39.83% of the total national population this Christmas holiday.  In a written statement the Indonesian Minister of Transportation Budi Karya Sumadi revealed, “In last year’s Christmas holiday it was predicted that 44.17 million people would move, while this year it is predicted that it will be 107.63 million people. So the increase is very significant above 100% (143.65%).” The survey results suggest that 45% of domestic travelers will be heading to tourist destinations such as Bali, while 30% will be traveling to their homes outside of major cities, and 18% will be traveling to their families in their hometowns. Most domestic tourists will be traveling by road in private vehicles across the country. However, the survey shows that an increased amount of travelers will be using public transport where available. Domestic travelers set to travel by train is predicted to be 13.16%, 14.79 million people, and travelers by planes will reach 11.91% which is around 13.38 million people. The busiest airports will be I Gusti Ngurah Rai International in Bali and Soekarno Hatta Airport in Jakarta. These figures are only an indication of the number of domestic tourists on the move during the end of December.  In 2022, Bali welcomed over one million tourists, international and domestic combined between Christmas Eve and New Year.  Minister Sumadi concluded, “We will coordinate intensively with regional governments, the police, toll road managers, BMKG, the National SAR Agency, and other related elements.” The survey shows that the peak flow of outbound travel is set to take place on, Friday 22nd and Saturday 23rd December 2023, and 30th December.  The inbound peak travel dates are predicted to fall on Monday 1st and Tuesday 2nd January 2024.  For international travelers planning their Christmas and New Year vacations in Bali, what does this mean? I Gusti Ngurah Rai International Airport and partner airlines have already confirmed that more flights will be scheduled throughout December to help keep up with the huge spike in travel demand. Officials have said that this increased flight availability will also help stabilize prices, preventing tickets from skyrocketing, especially at the last minute.  Popular airlines like Air Asia, Batik Air, Indonesia’s Garuda, Citilink, Lion Air, and Super Air Jet have all laid on increased international and domestic flights in preparation for next month. Tourists planning to travel by driving around the island over the Christmas and New Year holidays should brace for traffic, especially traveling to and from the airport and heading to the island’s biggest attractions.  It is very popular for tourists on vacation in Bali to spend a few nights in one resort, and a few nights in another area of the island. It is highly advisable to travel as early in the morning as possible between resorts in order to reduce the risk of being caught in traffic during the holidays. "

        "text_content": "As a travel destination, Bali has a lot to offer nature lovers and wildlife enthusiasts. For decades, swimming with turtles has been a bucket-list adventure that Bali has been all too ready to offer tourists.  But as tourism on the island continues to boom, conservationists are concerned about the influence development has on turtle habitats.  The Founder of the Kuta Beach Sea Turtle Conservation Center (KBSTCC) I Gusti Ngurah Tresna, also known affectionately as Mr Turtle, has been an advocate for the wellbeing of wild turtles in Kuta Beach and the surrounding areas for decades.  Tresna has recently reached out to reporters to share his observations about how tourism is changing turtle nestling habits in the island’s busiest beaches.  For centuries, turtles have been laying their eggs on Kuta Beach. But as beach use changes the environment, Tresna is noticing that turtles are moving to different locations to nest.  He and his teams have seen that German Beach and Sekeh Beach, and to the north, Legian Beach and Seminyak Beach are also seeing increasing turtle nesting sites; but that overall, the number of nests is decreasing. A post shared by Bali Sea Turtle Society (BSTS) (@baliseaturtlesociety) Tresna told reporters “Indeed, currently the tendency for turtles to lay their eggs has shifted slightly to the south and north of Kuta Beach. Turtles look for places that are dark and not too busy.”  However, turtles nesting on Kuta Beach, German Beach, Sekeh Beach, Legian Beach, and Seminyak Beach are hardly welcomed by undisturbed peace.  All of these beaches have buildings either on the beach, or directly opposite the sand. Bright lights in the Kuta, Legian, and Seminyak area can be seen from as far along the Canggu, and even over the ocean along the Bukit Peninsula.  A post shared by Bali Sea Turtle Society (BSTS) (@baliseaturtlesociety) Tresna added “This does not mean that there are absolutely no turtles laying eggs along Kuta Beach. There are still turtles laying eggs in the Kuta Beach area, especially those without abrasion barriers, namely in front of the Kuta Beach Task Force office to the south.” He noted that coastal erosion also has a part to play in the changing nesting habits of turtles and that he and his teams support the work of Badung Regency to mitigate coastal erosion on Kuta Beach.  A post shared by Bali Sea Turtle Society (BSTS) (@baliseaturtlesociety) This week the Badung Regency Public Works and Spatial Planning (PUPR) Department is getting started on a new project to construct coastal revetments on a number of popular tourist beaches in an effort to protect the coast from abrasion.  Revetments will be built on Kuta Beach, and also at Pandawa Beach, Cemagi Beach, and Pererenan Beach. Speaking on behalf of the PUPR Badung Office, AA Rama Putra, told reporters “The work area is from the front of Bentar Utama Temple to the north.” “We hope that with this step we can maintain the sustainability of the environment around Kuta Beach and provide better protection for the affected infrastructure.”  Tourists will notice more building activity on Kuta Beach for the next 2-3 weeks. The work should be completed in time for the Christmas and New Year holidays.  Tresna told reporters, “We have been carrying out conservation efforts for 23 years. So when people find out that a turtle is laying eggs, they already know what to do. So they have covered it first and then informed us. Sometimes tourists also inform us.”  It is imperative that if tourists come across a turtle nest, especially if hatchings are being born, to not interfere with the process at all.  While many tourists worry that the turtles do not have the strength to hatch through the sand, intervening with the process poses a huge threat to their survival.  The nest should be left alone, cordoned off if possible and the teams at Kuta Beach Sea Turtle Conservation Center or the BKSDA informed.  Tresna revealed that so far this year at least 275 Olive Ridley turtle nests have been found in the Kuta Beach area, with a total of around 50-60 thousand eggs. However, this number is relatively low compared to the previous year.  He concluded “The turtle nesting season is usually March to October, then stops when the rainy season arrives. Now it’s a bit late, but this month alone we still found one nest appearing.” "

        "text_content": "In November alone three tourists in Bali have been reported to have died in traffic collisions on the island’s roads.  Tragically, around this time last year Bali also saw a sharp rise in the number of fatalities on the roads. With this in mind, authorities in Buleleng Regency are working to change the way tourists hire vehicles in hopes the same approach may be adopted island-wide.  In November three foreign nationals were killed on Buleleng Regency’s roads in separate incidents. On 3rd November a 24-year-old British tourist died in a hit-and-run in Tajun Village in broad daylight.  On 11th November a Czech tourist was killed in a collision with a truck in Pemuteran Village. On 14th November a 24-year-old Czech citizen was killed in a collision with a pickup truck in Pejarakan Village.  Concerned by the rising number of tourist collisions on Bali’s roads the Head of Traffic Unit for Buleleng Police, AKP Bachtiar Arifin, has spoken to reporters about how and where changes must be made.  AKP Arifin told reporters “What is clear is that we will carry out outreach to rental services and hotels, including limiting and selectively using motorbikes, especially foreign nationals.” He continued to explain that hotel owners who provide motorbike rental services will be asked to take preventative steps by accompanying foreign guests themselves if they want to travel by motorbike.  He said, “This is part of an effort to maintain the safety of foreigners staying at the hotels they accompany.”  AKP Arifin reminded tourists and motorcycle rental providers that the requirement for foreigners to ride motorbikes on the streets of Indonesia is to at least have an international driver’s license and to obey the laws of the road such as wearing a helmet.  He added “Apart from that, we will increase patrols in places where there are many foreigners. We will even carry out law enforcement if foreigners are found to be violating this.” Earlier this year, before his term as Bali governor came to a close, Wayan Koster formally banned tourists from hiring mopeds directly from local people.  Ex-Governor Koster doubled down on laws that state that foreigners may only rent vehicles from authorized providers. Koster made it clear that tourists can only hire a motorcycle from a business that is fully registered with the relevant provincial and national trade agencies or the transportation rental association in Bali. This reinforcement of the law means that tourists cannot rent a motorcycle from an accommodation provider owner, local friend, or motorcycle rental owner who is not a formally registered motorcycle rental company.  It is evident that AKP Arifin and his teams in Buleleng Regency want to take this a step further and are calling on rental providers to take more responsibility over their rental vehicles and who they lease them out to.  Tourists planning their next visit to Bali and who are planning to hire a motorcycle are being urged to check and double-check the nuances of their travel, health, and driving insurance policies.  Over the last decade, there have been countless cases of tourists in Bali who hopped on a rental moped thinking they were unconditionally covered in the event of a collision. Far too many tourists have learned only when it is too late that a tiny detail on their insurance policy, such as only being covered for moped up to 125cc or needing to have converted their driving licenses into international licenses, means that they will not be covered for their medical bills; many of which have been hundreds of thousands of dollars.  Every policy from every provider and every country is different, and tourists are urged to be super clear about their coverage before making any decisions about driving in Bali, especially this festive season.

        "text_content": "The Acting Governor of Bali, Sang Made Mahendra Jaya, is encouraging tourists to experience more of the traditional Balinese culture.  While visiting temples and trying traditional Balinese food is a popular way for tourists to appreciate the island’s unique heritage, Acting Governor Mahendra Jaya wants to see tourists really dive in deep.  Jembrana Regency has just celebrated the 2023 Makepung Governor’s Cup. The sporting event was attended by Acting Governor Mahendra Jaya and other leading officials. But what is Makepung?  This unique sport has brought anthropologists, journalists, and culture lovers to Bali for decades. The sport is exhibited throughout Indonesia, especially in Java. However, Jembrana Regency is the real home of buffalo racing.  During the sporting season, Makepung races are held across Jembrana Regency every two weeks and always on Sunday. The season culminates in the Makepung Governor’s Cup. Makepung is a serious business and an ancient part of Balinese culture that is still thriving today. Race day is a huge occasion, the water buffalo’s horns are painted and the animals often wear headdresses.  Similar to carriage racing with horses, the Makepung involves racing water buffalo who are pulling a chariot-style cart around a 125m long rice paddle track.  Four jockeys compete at a time with two buffalo pulling each chariot. Racers from the east of the island typically wear red and those from the westerly regions wear green. Though loved by many, Makepung does attract some controversy, similar to the criticisms of horse racing. Speaking to the media during the 2023 Makepung Governor’s Cup, Acting Governor Mahendra Jaya shared, “Apart from being an expression of traditional cultural art that must be preserved, Makepung is also a potential tourist attraction, because of its characteristics and uniqueness that are second to none in Bali and even at the national and international level.” He continued, “The Makepung tradition as an icon and leading tourist attraction of Jembrana Regency has been recognized and recorded as one of the Intangible Natural Cultural Heritage [items for UNSECO].”  A post shared by Mekepung Jembrane (@makepung_jembranaa) “In this regard, we must be able to maintain this award by continuing to strive, commit, and be creative to improve its quality and attractiveness so that it is true, it can really provide benefits.” The promotion of Makepung racing to tourists would certainly go a long way in bringing more tourists to Jembrana Regency.  The area is often overlooked by international tourists in Bali since it covers most of the southwest of the island, sitting over 3-hours away from the major tourist attractions and resorts in Badung Regency. Acting Governor Mahendra Jaya addresses the concern that promoting Makepung racing to tourists in the modern day may be tricky, especially since many organizations are working to eliminate animal entertainment in the tourism industry.  He noted, however, that from the provincial government’s perspective, the preservation and promotion of Makepung racing has benefits in the tourism and cultural sense, as well as a positive impact on the agricultural sector. A post shared by Dayan Wieliam Photography (@dwphotography86) Acting Governor Mahendra Jaya explained that moving forward, Bali must develop more tourism businesses and experiences that create destinations that can compete with other resorts on the island, and around the world; and that this requires a unique edge.  In his view, Makepung racing can help establish villages across Jembrana Regency as tourism destinations that will support community empowerment and boost the economy.  A post shared by Fira Mikael Kwan (@firakwan) It is clear that leaders in the tourism space do want to see Jemrbana and West Bali put on the tourist map.  The Head of the Jembrana Tourism and Culture Service, Anak Agung Komang Sapta Negara, recently told reporters that ticket sales at leading attractions are below target for this time of year.  A post shared by INFORMASI MENARIK SEPUTAR BALI (@sirahbaliinfo) As Jembrana awaits the development of the island’s biggest theme park, the new Paramount Park & Gardens, there is plenty for tourists to explore.  Starting with the West Bali National Park, tourists are encouraged to add the seawater swimming pool in Delodberawah Village, the Gilimanuk Early Human Museum, in addition to Candikusuma Beach, and the majestic Gilimanuk Shiva Statue to their bucket list adventures.  "
